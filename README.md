# Immersive Narrative of Chinese Monuments | Spring 2022
This is the repository for the modeling projects done in GCHN-SHU 236 course at NYU Shanghai during Spring 2022. These projects: 1) experience the measurement, scaling, and crafting work of traditional Chinese wooden structures by direct modeling in the 3D environment; 2) explore the new frontiers in cyber-archiving the structure, space, and spirit of the Chinese monuments; 3) think critically about how the emerging field of the digital humanities can be applied to visualize the history and culture of China and create an immersive narrative. The modeling tool of these projects is Maya. Please feel free to email me at rd2910@nyu.edu for any more information.
